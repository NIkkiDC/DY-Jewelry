# DY-Jewelry
Java project 


# Project Overview 

Users can create an account with a username, email address, and password. The users information is protected by the security measures that were implemented throughout the project. 

The JavaBook/ Dy project was created so users can sign in  and have immediate  access to all of their information about jewelry on the David Yurman site. Once Users have logged in, they will then be able to utilize the search bar, and look for key pieces of jewelry they are interested in.

7. As a user I should be able to go to the DY site and filter through the different gems 

8. As a user I should be able to select one gem type, and only find gems that reflect what I have typed in the search bar 

9. As a user I should be able to search multiple things in the search bar at once so I can narrow down the exact type of pieces I am looking for. 

10.  As a customer, I want to be able to filter search results by metal type, stone type

make a purchase.

Acceptance criteria:
*The search filter options for metal type, stone type, and price range are clearly visible on the search page.

*The search filter options update the search results in real-time as the user selects them.

*The search filter options provide accurate results and do not include products that do not
meet the selected criteria.

# Reflection 

I am still struggling with the functionality of it all, I am diligently doing research to be sure the project provides accurate information and works properly.

One thing I would do differently is try my hardest to take more notes in classs, although it is rigorous since I have to code, I dont want to fall behind with the coding. I would also add more comments to myself in the code since it is my code, even though it essentially is not professional
